            <h2>Why hire me?</h2>
            <p><strong>As a business:</strong> As a freelance web developer, I have experience working with clients in a variety of disciplines, including writers, nurses, professors, and students to name a few. I also have experience as a technical consultant at the University of Scranton. There I assisted students and faculty with a variety of technical support issues. Through my combined work experience and academic training I gained interpersonal and practical skills, making me an <strong>adaptable</strong> and <strong>dependable</strong> employee qualified for any technical field.</p>
            <p>My experience at a web development agency has also given me more experience working with a wide range of development projects from simple   <a href="//wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and <a href="//jekyllrb.com" target='_blank'>Jekyll</a> applications to full scale database heavy systems built with <a href="//laravel.com/" target='_blank'>Laravel</a> and <a href="//codeigniter.com/" target='_blank'>CodeIgniter</a></p>
            <p><strong>As an individual:</strong> My experience working as a web developer and technical consultant has shaped my philosophy on professional conduct. I always make myself approachable, easy to contact, and flexible in any way I can. I can meet you in person, by phone or video messaging, or whichever way is most convenient for you. I am also open to working out a payment method that best fits your needs.</p>
